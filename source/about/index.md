## $ whoami
I'm Kairos, a Y1 student studying Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. I have a strong interest in cybersecurity, research, quantum computing, AI, and essentially (almost) everything tech.

Lately, I have been getting deeper into **quantum computing**, and programming with **rust**. 

Additionally, I have been venturing around in **Linux**, including testing out various distros like openSUSE (my current daily driver), CAINE, Pop!_OS, and also doing some **sysadmin** stuff with RHEL and Rocky Linux.
